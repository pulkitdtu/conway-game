            <br>The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a 'cellular automaton', and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.
            <br>This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. 
            <br>It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. 
            <br>Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.
            <br>Life was invented by the mathematician John Conway in 1970. He choose the rules carefully after trying many other possibilities, some 
            <br>  of which caused the cells to die too fast and others which caused too many cells to be born. Life balances these tendencies, making 
            <br>  it hard to tell whether a pattern will die out completely, form a stable population, or grow forever.
            <br>  Life is just one example of a <em><font color="#6633CC"><b>cellular 
            <br>    automaton</b></font></em>, which is any system in which rules are applied to cells and their neighbors in a regular grid.
            <br>    There has been much recent interest in cellular automata, a field of mathematical research. Life is one of the simplest cellular automata 
            <br>   to have been studied, but many others have been invented, often to simulate systems in the real world.
            <br>       In addition to the original rules, Life can be played on other kinds of grids with more complex patterns. There are rules for playing 
            <br>  on hexagons arranged in a honeycomb pattern, and games where cells can have more than two states (imagine live cells with different 
            colors).
